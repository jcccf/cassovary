Scripts
=======

Scala
-----
All scripts in the scala directory should be run with ./build.sh [script name] [script arguments].
If there are problems running any scripts, modify the second last line of build.sh to increase or
reduce the heap size. For example,

    JAVA_OPTS="-server -Xmx8g -Xms4g"

Allows a maximum heap size of 8 GB and allows Java to start off with a heap size of 4 GB.

### RenumbererMapper [maxId | path/to/step2xr2.txt]

interactive terminal for the renumberer. If you provide a number as the argument, an empty
Renumberer is initialized with that capacity. If you provide a path to a Renumberer dump file
(which is generated by CachedDirectedGraph), it will load that instead.

### RunCDGServer

Runs a CachedDirectedGraph server to demonstrate Ostrich stats collection


Python
------
Python scripts require Python 2.6+

### map_ids_backward and map_ids_forward

If you set the renumber = true option in common.conf, a file step2xr2.txt
is produced in the cache directory. This contains the id > index mapping.
Use map_ids_backward to recover the original ids given a list of indices,
and use map_ids_forward to generate the correct indices given a list of ids.
